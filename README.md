# 📊 SQL Data Analysis Project

A full **retail sales analytics and reporting project** built entirely with SQL.  
This project demonstrates how to extract, clean, and analyze data to deliver actionable business insights — without relying on external BI tools.

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project simulates a **retail data warehouse** structured using a **star schema**, including:

- `fact_sales` – transactional sales data  
- `dim_products` – product master data  
- `dim_customers` – customer demographics and profile  

Using advanced SQL queries, I analyzed **sales trends, customer segments, and product performance**, creating reusable data views for business intelligence reporting.

## 🧩 Key Achievements
- Built **time-based trend analyses** (yearly, monthly, cumulative) for sales and customer metrics.  
- Designed **running total** and **moving average** queries to monitor performance over time.  
- Developed **customer segmentation logic** (VIP, Regular, New) using lifespan and spending.  
- Created **product performance benchmarking** against category and prior-year averages.  
- Built two **reporting views**:
  - `gold.report_customers` – customer analytics mart  
  - `gold.product_report` – product performance mart
